        In the <b>first stage of your evaluation</b>, you will be provided with text from a <b>section</b> of the textbook that has been divided into multiple <b>subsections</b>. 
        Each subsection will be enclosed within a bounding box and will include images at the end. 
        Your task is to evaluate the relevance, usefulness, and type of each image with respect to the text <b>only</b> within the same subsection. 
        You will be asked to answer the following questions regarding these evaluations:

        <ul>
            <li>Is this image <b>relevant</b> to educational concepts described in this <i>subsection</i> text?</li>
            <li>Is this image <b>redundant</b> compared to previous images in this <i>subsection</i>?</li>
            <li>What is the <b>type</b> of this image?</li>
        </ul>

        In the <b>second stage of the evaluation</b>, you will be reviewing the same subsections and images as before. 
        Your task is to evaluate the relevance and redundancy of each image in relation to the text and images within <b>all</b> the subsections in this section. 
        You will be provided with following specific questions to guide your evaluations:
        
        <ul>
            
            <li>Is this image <b>relevant</b> to educational concepts described in this <i>section</i>?</li>
            <li>Is this image <b>redundant</b> compared to previous images in this <i>section</i>?</li>
            <li>Is this image <b>didactically useful</b> for explaining this <i>section</i> text?</li>
        </ul>

        <b>Note</b>: It is important to complete the questions for the first stage before moving on to the second stage. 
        Additionally, please make sure to read the sections that do not have any images during the first stage, as they will be useful for answering the questions in the second stage.
