        These guidelines are intended for an evaluation study at ETH Zurich.
        <!-- If you did not, or are unsure, please <a href="big_instructions" target="_blank">read them here</a>. -->


        You will be evaluating the performance of an AI-based method that uses web images to assign images to textbook sections.
        You will be presented with text from a section of a textbook, which is divided into multiple subsections.
        Each image will be accompanied by questions that ask about the relationship between the text and the image, as well as the relationship between the image and other images in the subsection.
        At the end of the evaluation, you will be shown all the images again and asked some section-level questions.
        The goal of this study is to create more engaging and effective learning resources for students.

        In specific, with each image assigned to a subsection, you'll be posed with following questions:
        <ul>
            <li>Is this image relevant to educational concepts described in the subsection shown here?</li>
            <li>Is this image redundant as compared to images shown previously in this subsection?</li>
            <li>Is this image didactically useful for explaining the concept(s) described in subsection text?</li>
            <li>What is the type of this image?</li>
            <li>Is this image relevant to the educational concepts described in the section shown here?</li>
            <li>Is this image redundant as compared to the images shown previously at the end of this section? select one: (a) yes; (b) no; (c) undecided.</li>
            <li>Is this image didactically useful for explaining the concept(s) described in section text?</li>
        </ul>
        
        <!-- <ul>
            <li>Finally, at the end of the section, you will be presented with all the images again and asked questions as mentioned below. The purpose of the end-of-section questions is to determine the relevance, redundancy, and educational usefulness of the images in relation to subsections other than those assigned by the AI-based method.</li>
        </ul> -->

        Definition of Options (will also be shown during the annotation)

        Options concerning relevancy questions: 
        <ul>
            <li>relevant: some concept described in the subsection text is picturised in the image; </li>
            <li>somewhat-relevant: image is loosely on the same subject/topic domain as the subsection text, but is not exactly about the same concepts; </li>
            <li>irrelevant: not at all related to the subsection text.</li>
            <li>undecided: unable to make a decision, maybe because of my low understanding of the text or image.</li>
        </ul>
        
        Options concerning redundancy questions: 
        <ul>
            <li>yes: this image illustrates exactly the same concept as one of the previously shown images in the subsection (or section, if end-of-section evaluation);</li>
            <li>no: this image illustrates atleast some unique concepts as compared to the previously shown images in the subsection (or section, if end-of-section evaluation);</li>
            <li>undecided: unable to make a decision, maybe because I do not understand the concepts illustrated by this image.</li>
        </ul>

        Options concerning didactic usefulness questions:
        <ul>
            <li>yes: image will be appropriate for teaching the section to a student - I would like it here (with an appropriate caption) if I was learning from this textbook;</li>
            <li>no: image is not appropriate for teaching the section text; </li>
            <li>undecided: unable to make the decision, maybe because of my less understanding of the text or image.</li>
        </ul>

        Please answer the questions as they appear in the section layout, since order is important for redundancy related questions.
