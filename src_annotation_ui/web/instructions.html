        The goal of your task is to help us evaluate our research on Artificial Intelligence (AI) based methods for creating more engaging and effective textbooks for students. 
        You will be evaluating the performance of various AI-based methods that use images obtained from the internet to assign images to sections of a childrenâ€™s textbook. 

        <hr>

        In the <b>first stage of your evaluation</b>, you will be provided with text from a <b>section</b> of the textbook that has been divided into multiple <b>subsections</b>. 
        Each subsection will be enclosed within a bounding box and will include images at the end. 
        Your task is to evaluate the relevance, usefulness, and type of each image with respect to the text <b>only</b> within the same subsection. 
        You will be asked to answer the following questions regarding these evaluations:

        <ul>
            <li>Is this image <b>relevant</b> to educational concepts described in this <i>subsection</i> text?</li>
            <li>Is this image <b>redundant</b> compared to previous images in this <i>subsection</i>?</li>
            <li>Is this image <b>didactically useful</b> for explaining this <i>subsection</i> text?</li>
            <li>What is the <b>type</b> of this image?</li>
        </ul>

        In the <b>second stage of the evaluation</b>, you will be reviewing the same subsections and images as before. 
        Your task is to evaluate the relevance and redundancy of each image in relation to the text and images within <b>all</b> the subsections in this section. 
        You will be provided with following specific questions to guide your evaluations:
        
        <ul>
            
            <li>Is this image <b>relevant</b> to educational concepts described in this <i>section</i>?</li>
            <li>Is this image <b>redundant</b> compared to previous images in this <i>section</i>?</li>
            <!-- <li>Is this image <b>didactically useful</b> for explaining the concept(s) described in <i>section</i> text?</li> -->
        </ul>

        <b>Note</b>: It is important to complete the questions for the first stage before moving on to the second stage. 
        Additionally, please make sure to read the sections that do not have any images during the first stage, as they will be useful for answering the questions in the second stage.

        <!-- <ul>
            <li>Finally, at the end of the section, you will be presented with all the images again and asked questions as mentioned below. The purpose of the end-of-section questions is to determine the relevance, redundancy, and educational usefulness of the images in relation to subsections other than those assigned by the AI-based method.</li>
        </ul> -->

        <center><b>Explanation of Response Choices for Questions</b></center> <br> <center>(will also be shown during the annotation)</center> 

        <br>

        Choices concerning <b>relevancy</b> questions: 
        <ul>
            <li><i>relevant</i>: some concept described in the subsection/section text is picturised in the image; </li>
            <li><i>somewhat-relevant</i>: image is loosely on the same subject/topic domain as the subsection/section text, but is not exactly about the same concepts; </li>
            <li><i>irrelevant</i>: not at all related to the subsection/section text.</li>
            <li><i>undecided</i>: unable to make a decision, maybe because of my low understanding of the text or image.</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        
        Choices concerning <b>redundancy</b> questions: 
        <ul>
            <li><i>yes</i>: this image illustrates exactly the same concept as one of the previously shown images in the section;</li>
            <li><i>no</i>: this image illustrates atleast some unique concepts as compared to the previously shown images in the section;</li>
            <li><i>undecided</i>: unable to make a decision, maybe because I do not understand the concepts illustrated by this image.</li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        Choices concerning <b>didactic-usefulness</b> questions:
        <ul>
            <li><i>yes</i>: image will be appropriate for teaching the subsection/section to a student - I would like it here (with an appropriate caption) if I was learning from this textbook;</li>
            <li><i>no</i>: image is not appropriate for teaching the subsection/section text; </li>
            <li><i>undecided</i>: unable to make the decision, maybe because of my less understanding of the text or image.</li>
        </ul>
